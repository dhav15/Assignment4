# CP386: Assignment 4
## Motivation
This is a project for CP:386 at Wilfrid Laurier University. This program simulates a Bankers algorithm, an algorithm used to avoid deadlocks in operating systems. 
## Installation
Run with provided make file, may need to change main file to Question1.c to run.
## Screenshots
Enter RQ values based on assignment outline:

## Contribution
int main(int argc, char *argv[]); -> Dhavani & Judy  
void readFile(); -> Judy  
int safetyAlgorithm(); -> Dhavani  
int resourceRequest(char *command); -> Judy  
int resourceRelease(char *command); -> Judy  
void printStatus(); -> Dhavani  
void run(); -> Dhavani  
void *runner(void *param); -> Dhavani & Judy
## Features
This program is a representation of a banker algorithm, it provides functions resourceRequest, resourceRelease, printStatus, and Run.

Execute resourceRequest with RQ followed by 5 numbers(first being process id, last four being recources to be rquested)

Execute resourceRequest with RQ followed by 5 numbers(first being process id, last four being recources to be resourceRelease)

Execute printStatus with keyword Status
  - Will show all current 2d arrays (available, Max, allocation, need)

Execute Run with keyword Run
  - This will execute customers  as  threads  in  a  safe  se

* Dhavani Patel (@dhav15)
* Judy Praught (@Judy-Praught) - Had syncing issues with github, commits are less frequent (i.e. large amounts of code are added per commit)
